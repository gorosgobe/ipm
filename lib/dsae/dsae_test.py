"""
For N images, where each image can be summarised with F features, calculate the average
distance of each feature point to our expected center crop point for that image. This gives us NxF data points, which we
average to obtain the average distance of each feature, size 1xF. This gives us how
good each feature is. We can choose the minimum of this as the score.

If a feature consistently tracks the object, then its distance to the expected crop should be the smallest across all
demonstrations and trajectories.
